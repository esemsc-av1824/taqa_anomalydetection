## Technical Findings

1. **RobustScaler Effectiveness**: Consistent improvements across isolation forest models
2. **Contamination Rate Optimization**: Critical parameter, optimal range 0.15-0.25
3. **Challenging Data Value**: Revealed weaknesses not visible in simple synthetic data
4. **Difficulty-Based Analysis**: Hard anomalies remain challenging for most models

## Production Recommendations

### Immediate Deployment
- choke_position: +188.5% improvement
- delta_temp_open: +82.9% improvement

### Further Development Needed


## Next Steps

1. Deploy optimized models with >20% improvement
2. Implement production monitoring for recall by difficulty
3. Continue optimization for models with <70% recall
4. Validate with real-world data when available
